### Introduction 
In APCSA (Advanced Placement Computer Science A), we are learning about Java. Learning Java is somewhat similar to Javascript; so I am familiar with some of the code. In unit 4 we have been learning about Iterations which is like looping. Learning Iterations have been challenging because it is really confusing to understand. In this writeup I will talk about some learning moments and challenges which is mostly about confustion and not getting the material about unit 4.

### Challenge 1
One challegne I had when learning about unit 4 is nested loops. It is where there is a loop inside a loop. I didn't understand how this worked. But as time went on I learned that the outer loop controls the inside loop and the inner loops first then the outer loop. 
```Java
    int weeks = 3;
    int days = 7;

    // outer loop prints weeks
    for (int i = 1; i <= weeks; ++i) {
      System.out.println("Week: " + i);

      // inner loop prints days
      for (int j = 1; j <= days; ++j) {
        System.out.println("  Day: " + j);
      }
    }
```
For example in this nested loop I found in the internet, the output will print the number of the week and print the 7 days after that. 

### Challenge 2
Another challenge I had when learning unit 4 is making algorithms for strings. It was also confusing to understand. But after researching about it and watching videos it became easier to understand.
